Using these modded xml files could break the functioning of your DAYZ server, requiring a reinstall that would wipe
all player progress.

Using these modded xml files neccessitates increased regular restarts to prevent server crashing.

It is suggested you thoroughly test your server after applying these files to ensure proper
functioning of your server.

These modded types.xml files simply halve or remove the normal "ground" spawning of most food and drink items. Food and drink will still be found
in Zombies inventories, and inside other items.

To install these files simply download them to your local PC, rename the one you want use to types.xml, then upload these over the top of your existing
 file and restart your server.

Changes will take time to come into effect, depending on the population of players on your server.

GOOD LUCK!
